                Techable Blog aspires to strengthen your Ability in Technology. Of course that is an over ambitious goal.
                So, really what you'll find is just a blog that shares some positive headway made in areas of interest. Expect website and microprocessor, hardware and software projects.
                There are more ideas than time allows to solidify into projects and more projects than time allows to be written up into blog posts, so here are the easiest projects, simplistically described. Enjoy!
